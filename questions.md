# Questions

1. Why do we use static variables within the router class, like `$path` and `$routes`?
4. How does the `abstract controller class` work? (init a new TwigSession)
5. Routing does not work yet, I think there are two problems:
    * different project path on my course computer -> `http://localhost/PhpKurs2/fairshare/web/index.php` compared to http://fairshare.test on my own machine
    * different xxamp settings, I think it is not automatically looking for an index.php
6. Class Route, method run(): 
    * preg_match function -> why are we concatenating `$route['expression']` with `#`
