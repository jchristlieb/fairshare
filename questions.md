# Questions

1. Why do we use static variables within the router class, like `$path` and `$routes`?
2. What exactly is a callback variable like `$callback404` and how does it work?
3. Have not fully understood `public static function run()`, need a walk through with an example 
4. How does the `abstract controller class` work? (init a new TwigSession)
5. Routing does not seem to work yet, it may be because of a different path on my course computer -> `http://localhost/PhpKurs2/fairshare/web/index.php` compared to http://fairshare.test on my own machine
